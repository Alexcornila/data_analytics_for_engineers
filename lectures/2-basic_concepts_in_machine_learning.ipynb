    "* Machine learning models can be classified as **supervised** (trained to known dependent variable data) and **unsupervised** (no training data is provided). Supervised models include **regression** (continuous output variable) and **classification** (discrete/ordinal output variable). Unsupervised models include **clustering** (identification of similar groups) and **dimensional reduction** (projection onto fewer independent variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Machine learning models can be **convex** (**linear**) (single unique solution) or **non-convex** (**non-linear**) (multiple possible solutions), and **parametric** (fixed number of model parameters) or **non-parameteric** (number of parameters varies with amount of input data).\n",

    "* Prototype models provide insight into the basics of machine learning. You should understand the basics of generalized linear regression, k-nearest neighbor classification, k-means clustering, and principal component analysis."
