    "The transition from Matlab to Python is relatively easy, and there are tons of resources online for learning Python. This notebook will guide you through a few simple exercises to get the hang of some of the most noticable differences. **Please pay attention to how much time this assignment takes you. We will ask about this later.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Helpful Resources\n",
    "If you are new to Python this assignment may be very challenging. One great thing about Python is the wealth of helpful knowledge that is available online. You should get used to searching for keywords that you aren't familiar with and reading examples from sites like Stack Overflow. Reading examples and tutorials is the best way to learn. A few posts/sites that might be useful for this assignment are below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [String formatting](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-string-formatters-in-python-3)\n",
    "* [Python dictionaries](https://www.python-course.eu/dictionaries.php)\n",
    "* [Indentation](http://www.diveintopython.net/getting_to_know_python/indenting_code.html)\n",
    "* [Importing](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-import-modules-in-python-3)\n",

    "* [List comprehensions](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/01/python-tutorial-list-comprehension-examples/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that I have not read these tutorials closely, but they appear useful. I found each one in about 1 minute, so in the future you should be prepared to search for this supplementary information independently. Another strategy is to identify one of the many tutorial/courses online that makes the most sense to you and read through it. Don't worry if every detail doesn't make sense, just try to get the basics and you will pick the rest up as we go along.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Printing and formatting\n",
    "One difference from Matlab is that Python does not automatically print things, you have to tell it what to print. Fortunately, printing in Python is relatively straightforward with the \"print\" function, and it also has some fancy \"string formatting\" functionality. For homeworks you should print the answer unless otherwise stated. Use the print function to print \"Hello World\", \"Hello **planet**\", and \"Hello **planet** number **N**\" where **planet** and **N** are variables defined below."

    "The first difference is pretty simple: Python starts counting from zero. It also allows you to use \"negative indexing\" that counts from the end of the list, so that -1 is the last item, -2 next-to-last item, etc. Use zero and negative indexing to determine the first, last, and next-to-last item in the list \"A\" below. Don't worry about how \"A\" is generated, we will get to that later."

In Python **everything is an object** so you can easily inherit from existing built-in classes. The code below defines a class called \"SuperInteger\" that inherits from the built-in integer class. Add a method to this class called \"check_prime\" that will check if any SuperInteger is prime, and add an attribute called \"is_prime\" that will be set to True/False when \"check_prime\" is executed. If you do this properly the second block below should execute with the output \"True\". Remember that you can call your function that you defined above inside the check_prime method!"
